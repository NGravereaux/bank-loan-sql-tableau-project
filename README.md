## Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard (SQL, Tableau)

A synthetic dataset was used for this project to maintain the confidentiality of bank clients.

### Situation

I needed to analyze a large dataset related to bank loans and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan amounts, revolving balances, and payment verification status. The project involved integrating data from multiple sources and visualizing the results for better decision-making.

### Task

My role was to extract relevant data using SQL queries, process the data using Python, and create a dynamic, interactive dashboard using Tableau Public to present the findings effectively.

### Action

I used SQL to retrieve and aggregate the necessary data, then leveraged Python to automate the data extraction and export the results as CSV files. Finally, I created a Tableau Public dashboard to visualize key insights.

### Impact

The project provided valuable insights into loan performance, payment status, and customer demographics, helping the organization make informed decisions and improve reporting accuracy.

### Reflection

- **What I learned**: I enhanced my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau for data processing and visualization.
- **What I would do differently**: I would consider using a more scalable data pipeline for better workflow management.
- **Advice for others**: Focus on automating data extraction with Python and ensure the dashboard is intuitive and responsive across devices.
